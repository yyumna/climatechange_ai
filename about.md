# About Climate Change AI

Climate Change AI is a group of volunteers from academia and industry who believe in using machine learning, where it is relevant, to help tackle the climate crisis.  We aim to facilitate meaningful action by a range of stakeholders &mdash; researchers and engineers, entrepreneurs and investors, established businesses, the public sector, and more.

We believe that:
* **There are many ways to have an impact:** The diversity of problems posed by climate change can be seen as an opportunity; there are many ways to have an impact.
* **AI is a powerful tool:** AI and ML can enable or accelerate many strategies to address climate change. That said, it is not a silver bullet.
* **Collaboration is key:** Effective solutions require cooperation between AI/ML experts and other stakeholders working in areas relevant to climate change.

## Our Vision
A world where effective climate change mitigation and robust adaptation strategies are deployed for the benefit of all.

## Our Mission
To empower work that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis and is well-served by machine learning tools.

## Our Goals

* To facilitate work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning through resource- and knowledge-sharing.
* To enable impactful collaborations by connecting machine learning experts and experts working in areas relevant to climate change through physical and digital platforms.
* To promote discourse about best practices regarding the use of machine learning in climate change domains.
