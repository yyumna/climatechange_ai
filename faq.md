# Frequently Asked Questions

### I want to learn more about climate change and machine learning. Where can I start?
We encourage you to check out our <a href="{{ site.paper_url }}" target="_blank">paper</a>, which provides a detailed guide of ways machine learning can be used to tackle climate change, as well as the accompanying [resources](https://www.climatechange.ai/resources.html) on our website.

### I’ve read the paper and checked out the resources. What should I do next?
We encourage you to join the conversations on our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a>, sign up for our [newsletter](https://www.climatechange.ai/newsletter.html), or submit to one of our [workshops](https://www.climatechange.ai/workshops.html). For additional suggestions, please check out our page on [how to get involved](https://www.climatechange.ai/get_involved.html).

### I don’t know much about AI. Can I still be involved?
Yes! One of our goals is to connect people working in areas relevant to climate change with experts in machine learning. For some helpful background on AI and machine learning, we encourage you to check out resources such as this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Coursera course</a>.

### I don’t know much about climate change. Can I still be involved?
Yes! One of our goals is to connect people working in machine learning to experts working in areas relevant to climate change. For some helpful background readings on climate change and related areas, we encourage you to check out our [resources page](https://www.climatechange.ai/resources.html).

### I want to take on a project at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. Can you recommend a project for me to work on?
We encourage you to check out <a href="{{ site.paper_url }}" target="_blank">our paper</a> and [previous workshops](https://www.climatechange.ai/workshops.html#past-workshops) for ideas. To discuss project ideas or find collaborators, you can head over to our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> or join us at one of our [workshops](https://www.climatechange.ai/workshops.html).

### Can I collaborate with Climate Change AI on a research project?
Our goal at Climate Change AI is to promote impactful collaborations, but our organization does not do any research in-house. Please head over to our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> to find collaborators for research projects.

### I think it’s important to fight climate change, but I don’t think AI is where we should focus our efforts. Isn’t this a big distraction?
We believe AI can play a useful role in many climate change strategies (as detailed in our <a href="{{ site.paper_url }}" target="_blank">paper</a>), and that it is important for AI and machine learning experts to join the global effort against climate change. That said, AI is only one piece of the puzzle; policy and technical approaches other than AI will also be critical to tackling climate change. Given the urgency of acting on climate change, we need all hands on deck.

### Can my organization partner with Climate Change AI?
We do not offer formal partnerships, but are eager to put our heads together with like-minded organizations. If you’d like to chat, please [send us an email](mailto:info@climatechange.ai).

### I have an event, position, call for proposals, or other announcement that is relevant to climate change and AI. Can I advertise it through Climate Change AI? 
 Please feel free to share your announcement with us via [email](mailto:info@climatechange.ai); we will advertise relevant announcements through our [newsletter](https://www.climatechange.ai/newsletter.html). You can also share announcements in our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a>.

### I am a data scientist looking for a career in using AI to tackle climate change. Any tips on finding jobs in this space?
 We encourage you to sign up for our [newsletter](https://www.climatechange.ai/newsletter.html), which includes announcements about jobs and opportunities in climate change and AI. You may also be interested in checking out companies or institutions cited in our <a href="{{ site.paper_url }}" target="_blank">paper</a> or who have presented at our [workshops](https://www.climatechange.ai/workshops.html). Consider looking at pages and job boards geared towards specific areas relevant to climate change (e.g. those areas listed in the table of contents of our paper), and at those geared towards jobs in different kinds of sectors (e.g. tech, traditional industry, the public sector, and NGOs).

### I am an investor looking to fund companies and startups at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.  Can you suggest any companies and startups that may be a good fit?
While we do not currently offer formal partnerships with investors, please [send us an email](mailto:info@climatechange.ai) if you would like to discuss opportunities in this space. We also suggest using our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a>, as well as the references and footnotes in our <a href="{{ site.paper_url }}" target="_blank">paper</a>, to identify promising companies and startups at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

### My company/organization has a project/business idea, and we would like to assess its climate impact. Can we contact you to conduct this assessment?
We do not offer consulting services; however, please feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:info@climatechange.ai) or to post on our <a href="https://forum.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> for feedback on related projects.
