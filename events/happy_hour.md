# Climate Change AI Happy Hour Series

## Next event: Wednesday 6 January @ 12:30-1:30pm Eastern Time/6:30pm CET

Join us via Gather.Town for our regular virtual happy hour community events taking place on the first and third Wednesday of every month.

The events aim to provide an informal space for people to network and engage in discussions with others interested in or currently working at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. They are open to all and we hope to see you there!
