  paper_title: 'BISCUIT: Building Intelligent System Customer Investment Tools'
  abstract: Energy use in buildings account for approximately half of global electricity
    consumption and a significant amount of CO2 emissions. Often, the higher energy
    usage in buildings are accounted to old and poorly maintained infrastructure and
    equipments. On the other hand, Smart buildings are capable of achieving energy
    efficiency by using intelligent services such as indoor positioning, personalized
    lighting, demand-based heating ventilation and air-conditioning, automatic fault
    detection and recovery etc. However, most buildings nowadays lack the basic components
    and infrastructure to support such services. The investment decision of intelligent
    system design and retrofit can be a daunting task, because it involves both hardware
    (sensors, actuators, servers) and software (operating systems, service algorithms),
    which have issues of compatibility, functionality constraints, and opportunities
    of co-design of synergy. Our work proposes a user-oriented investment decision
    toolset using optimization and machine learning techniques aimed at handling the
    complexity of exploration in the large design space and to enhance cost-effectiveness,
    energy efficiency, and human-centric values. The toolset is demonstrated in a
    case study to retrofit a medium-sized building, where it is shown to propose a
    design that significantly lowers the overall investment cost while achieving user
    specifications.

  paper_title: Deep Reinforcement Learning based Renewable Energy Error Compensable
    Forecasting
  abstract: Recently, renewable energy is rapidly integrated into the power grid to
    prevent climate change, and accurate forecasting of renewable generation becomes
    critical for reliable power system operation. However, existing forecasting algorithms
    only focused on reducing forecasting errors without considering error compensability
    by using a large-scale battery. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy called
    error compensable forecasting. We switch the objective of forecasting from reducing
    errors to making errors compensable by leveraging a battery. Specifically, we
    propose a deep reinforcement learning based framework having forecasting in the
    loop of control. Extensive simulations show that the proposed one-hour ahead forecasting
    achieves zero error for more than 98% of time while reducing the operational expenditure
    by up to 44%.

  paper_title: Missing-insensitive Short-term Load Forecasting Leveraging Autoencoder
    and LSTM
  abstract: Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is fundamental for power system operation,
    demand response, and also greenhouse gas emission reduction. So far, most deep
    learning-based STLF techniques require intact data, but many real-world datasets
    contain missing values due to various reasons, and thus missing imputation using
    deep learning is actively studied. However, missing imputation and STLF have been
    considered independently so far. In this paper, we jointly consider missing imputation
    and STLF and propose a family of autoencoder/LSTM combined models to realize missing-insensitive
    STLF. Specifically, autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), and convolutional
    autoencoder (CAE) are investigated for extracting features, which is directly
    fed into the input of LSTM. Our results show that three proposed autoencoder/LSTM
    combined models significantly improve forecasting accuracy compared to the baseline
    models of deep neural network and LSTM. Furthermore, the proposed CAE/LSTM combined
    model outperforms all other models for 5%-25% of random missing data.

  paper_title: A Machine Learning Pipeline to Predict Vegetation Health
  abstract: Agricultural droughts can exacerbate poverty and lead to famine. Timely
    distribution of disaster relief funds is essential to help minimise the impact
    of drought. Indices of vegetation health are indicative of higher risk of agricultural
    drought, but their prediction remains challenging, particularly in Africa. Here,
    we present an open-source machine learning pipeline for climate-related data.
    Specifically, we train and analyse a recurrent model to predict pixel-wise vegetation
    health in Kenya.

  paper_title: Understanding the dynamics of climate-crucial food choice behaviours
    using Distributional Semantics
  abstract: |-
    Developed countries must make swift movements toward plant-based diets in order to mitigate climate change and maintain food security. However, researchers
    currently lack clear insight into the psychological dimensions that influence food
    choice, which is necessary to encourage the societal adaptation of new diets. In
    this project, we use Skip-gram word embeddings trained on the ukWaC corpus
    as a lens to study the implicit mental representations people have of foods. Our
    data-driven insights expand on findings from traditional, interview-based studies
    by uncovering implicit mental representations, allowing a better understanding the
    complex combination of conscious and sub-conscious processes surrounding food
    choice. In particular, our findings shed light on the pervasiveness of meat as the
    ‘centre’ of the meal in the UK.

  paper_title: 'SolarNet: A Deep Learning Framework to Map Solar Plants In China From
    Satellite Imagery'
  abstract: Renewable energy such as solar power is critical to fight the ever more
    serious climate, how to effectively detect renewable energy has became an important
    issue for governments. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework named
    SolarNet which is designed to perform semantic segmentation on large scale satellite
    imagery data to detect solar farms. SolarNet has successfully mapped 439 solar
    farms in China, covering near 2000 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of
    whole Shenzhen city or two and a half of New York city. To the best of our knowledge,
    it is the first time that we used deep learning to reveal the locations and sizes
    of solar farms in China, which could provide insights for solar power companies,
    climate finance and markets.

  paper_title: Embedding Hard Physical Constraints in Convolutional Neural Networks
    for 3D Turbulence
  abstract: Deep learning approaches have shown much promise for climate sciences,
    especially in dimensionality reduction and compression of large datasets. A major
    issue in deep learning of climate phenomena, like geophysical turbulence, is the
    lack of physical guarantees.  In this work, we propose a general framework to
    directly embed the notion of incompressible fluids into Convolutional Neural Networks,
    for coarse-graining of turbulence. These \textbf{physics-embedded neural networks}
    leverage interpretable strategies from numerical methods and computational fluid
    dynamics to enforce physical laws and boundary conditions by taking advantage
    the mathematical properties of the underlying equations. We demonstrate results
    on 3D fully-developed turbulence, showing that the \textit{physics-aware inductive
    bias} drastically improves local conservation of mass, without sacrificing performance
    according to several other metrics characterizing the fluid flow.

  paper_title: 'DETECTION OF HOUSING AND AGRICULTURE AREAS ON DRY-RIVERBEDS FOR THE
    EVALUATION OF RISK BY LANDSLIDES USING LOW-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY BASED
    ON DEEP LEARNING. STUDY ZONE: LIMA, PERU'
  abstract: The expansion of human settlements in Peru has caused risk exposure to
    landslides. However, this risk could increase because the intensity of the El
    niño phenomenon will be greater in the coming years,  increasing rainfall on the
    Peruvian coast. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for detecting housing
    areas and agricultural lands in low-resolution satellite imagery in order to analyze
    potential risk in case of unexpected landslides. It was developed by creating
    two datasets from Lima Metropolitana in Peru, one of which is for detecting dry
    riverbeds and agriculture lands, and the other for classifying housing areas.
    We applied data augmentation based on geometrical methods and trained architectures
    based on U-net methods separately and then, overlap the results for risk assessment.
    We found that there are areas with significant potential risk that have been classified
    by the Peruvian government as medium or low risk areas. On this basis, it is recommended
    obtain a dataset with better resolution that can identify how many housing areas
    will be affected and take the appropriate prevention measures. Further research
    in post-processing is needed for suppress noise in our results.

  paper_title: Non-linear interlinkages and key objectives amongst the Paris Agreement
    and the Sustainable Development Goals
  abstract: "The United Nations' ambitions to combat climate change and prosper human
    development are manifested in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs), respectively. These are inherently inter-linked as progress towards
    some of these objectives may accelerate or hinder progress towards others. We
    investigate how these two agendas influence each other by defining networks of
    18 nodes, consisting of the 17 SDGs and climate change, for various groupings
    of countries. We compute a non-linear measure of conditional dependence, the partial
    distance correlation, given any subset of the remaining 16 variables. These correlations
    are treated as weights on edges, and weighted eigenvector centralities are calculated
    to determine the most important nodes. \n\nWe find that SDG 6, clean water and
    sanitation, and SDG 4, quality education, are most central across nearly all groupings
    of countries. In developing regions, SDG 17, partnerships for the goals, is strongly
    connected to the progress of other objectives in the two agendas whilst, somewhat
    surprisingly, SDG 8, decent work and economic growth, is not as important in terms
    of eigenvector centrality."

  paper_title: A CONTINUAL LEARNING APPROACH FOR LOCAL LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
    IN LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS
  abstract: 'An increasingly important dimension in the quest for mitigation and monitoring
    of environmental change is the role of citizens. The crowd-based monitoring of
    local level anthropogenic alterations is essential towards measurable changes
    in different contributing factors to climate change. With the proliferation of
    mobile technologies here in the African continent, it is useful to have machine
    learning based models that are deployed on mobile devices and that can learn continually
    from streams of data over extended time, possibly pertaining to different tasks
    of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate the localisation of deforestation indicators
    using lightweight models and extend to incorporate data about wildﬁres and smoke
    detection. The idea is to show the need and potential of continual learning approaches
    towards building robust models to track local environmental alterations.

  paper_title: 'WeatherBench: A benchmark dataset for data-driven weather forecasting'
  abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are a crucial prerequisite for climate change
    adaptation. Can these be provided by deep learning? First studies show promise,
    but the lack of a common dataset and evaluation metrics make inter-comparison
    between the proposed models difficult. In fact, despite the recent research surge
    in data-driven weather forecasting, there is currently no standard approach for
    evaluating the proposed models. Here we introduce WeatherBench, a benchmark dataset
    for data-driven medium-range weather forecasting. We provide data derived from
    an archive of assimilated earth observations for the last 40 years that has been
    processed to facilitate the use in machine learning models. We propose a simple
    and clear evaluation metric which will enable a direct comparison between different
    proposed methods. Further, we provide baseline scores from simple linear regression
    techniques, purely physical forecasting models as well as existing deep learning
    weather forecasting models. All data and code are made publicly available along
    with tutorials for getting started. We believe WeatherBench will provide a useful
    and reproducible way of evaluating data-driven weather forecasting models and
    we hope that it will accelerate research in this direction.

  paper_title: 'SMArtCast: Predicting soil moisture interpolations into the future
    using Earth observation data in a deep learning framework'
  abstract: 'Soil moisture is critical component of crop health and monitoring it
    can enable further actions for increasing yield or preventing catastrophic die
    off. As climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events and
    reduces the predictability of weather, and non-optimal soil moistures for crops
    may become more likely. In this work, we use a series of LSTM architectures to
    analyze measurements of soil moisture and vegetation indices derived from satellite
    imagery. The system learns to predict the future values of these measurements.
    These spatially sparse values and indices are used as input features to an interpolation
    method that infer spatially dense moisture maps at multiple depths for a future
    time point. This has the potential to provide advance warning for soil moistures
    that may be inhospitable to crops across an area with limited monitoring capacity. '

  paper_title: Prediction of Bayesian Intervals for Tropical Storms
  abstract: 'Building on recent research for prediction of hurricane trajectories
    using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we have developed improved methods and
    generalized the approach to predict a confidence interval region of the trajectory
    utilizing Bayesian methods. Tropical storms are capable of causing severe damage,
    so accurately predicting their trajectories can bring significant benefits to
    cities and lives, especially as they grow more intense due to climate change effects.
    By implementing the Bayesian confidence interval using dropout in an RNN, we improve
    the actionability of the predictions, for example by estimating the areas to evacuate
    in the landfall region. We used an RNN to predict the trajectory of the storms
    at 6-hour intervals. We used latitude, longitude, windspeed, and pressure features
    from a Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) dataset of about
    500 tropical storms in the Atlantic Ocean. Our results show how neural network
    dropout values affect our predictions and Bayesian intervals. '

  paper_title: 'MobilityNet: Towards a Public Dataset for Multi-modal Mobility Research'
  abstract: |-
    Influencing transportation demand can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Individual user mobility models are key to influencing demand at the personal and structural levels. Constructing such models is a challenging task that depends on a number of interdependent steps. Progress on this task is hamstrung by the lack of high quality public datasets.
    We introduce MobilityNet: the first step towards a common ground for multi-modal mobility research. MobilityNet solves the holistic evaluation, privacy preservation and fine grained ground truth problems through the use of artificial trips, control phones, and repeated travel. It currently includes 1080 hours of data from both
    Android and iOS, representing 16 different travel contexts and 4 different sensing configurations.

    turbulence in geophysical flows. Modeling these flows and explaining its associated
    spatio-temporal phenomena are notoriously difficult tasks. Navier-Stokes (NS)
    equations describe all the details of the fluid motions, but require accounting
    for unfeasibly many degrees of freedom in the regime of developed turbulence.
    Model reduction and surrogate modeling of turbulence is a general methodology
    aiming to circumvent this curse of dimensionality. Originally driven by phenomenological
    considerations,  multiple attempts to model-reduce NS equations got a new boost
    recently with Deep Learning (DL), trained on the ground truth data, e.g. extracted
    from high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). However, early attempts
    of building NNs to model turbulence has also revealed its lack of interpretability
    as the most significant shortcoming. In this paper we address the key challenge
    of devising reduced but, at least partially, interpretable model. We take advantage
    of the balance between strong mathematical foundations and the physical interpretability
    of wavelet theory to build a spatio-temporally reduced dynamical map which fuses
    wavelet based spatial decomposition with spatio-temporal modeling based on Convolutional
    Long Short Term Memory (C-LSTM) architecture.  It is shown that the wavelet-based
    NN makes progress in scaling to large flows, by reducing computational costs and
    GPU memory requirements. '

  paper_title: 'Benchmarks for Grid Flexibility Prediction: Enabling Progress and
    Machine Learning Applications'
  abstract: Decarbonizing the grid is recognized worldwide as one of the objectives
    for the next decades. Its success depends on our ability to massively deploy renewable
    resources, but to fully benefit from those, grid flexibility is needed. In this
    paper we put forward the design of a benchmark that will allow for the systematic
    measurement of demand response programs' effectiveness, information that we do
    not currently have. Furthermore, we explain how the proposed benchmark will facilitate
    the use of Machine Learning techniques in grid flexibility applications.

  paper_title: Machine Learning Approaches to Safeguarding Continuous Water Supply
    in the Arid and Semi-arid Lands of Northern Kenya
  abstract: Arid and semi-arid regions (ASALs) in developing countries are heavily
    affected by the effects of global warming and climate change, leading to adverse
    climatic conditions such as drought and flooding. This paper explores the problem
    of fresh-water access in northern Kenya and measures being taken to safeguard
    water access despite these harsh climatic changes. We present an integrated water
    management and decision-support platform, eMaji Manager, that we developed and
    deployed in five ASAL counties in northern Kenya to manage waterpoint access for
    people and livestock. We then propose innovative machine learning methods for
    understanding waterpoint usage and repair patterns for sensor-instrumented waterpoints
    (e.g., boreholes).  We explore sub-sequence discriminatory models and recurrent
    neural networks to predict water-point failures, improve repair response times
    and ultimately support continuous access to water.

  paper_title: Accelerated  Data Discovery for Scalable Climate Action
  abstract: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
    planet must decarbonize by 50% by 2030 in order to keep global warming below 1.5C.
    This goal calls for a prompt and massive deployment of solutions in all societal
    sectors - research, governance, finance, commerce, health care, consumption. One
    challenge for experts and non-experts is access to the rapidly growing body of
    relevant information, which is currently scattered across many weakly linked domains
    of expertise. We propose a large-scale, semi-automatic, AI-based discovery system
    to collect, tag, and semantically index this information. The ultimate goal is
    a near real-time, partially curated data catalog of global climate information
    for rapidly scalable climate action.

  paper_title: YOU FORGOT IT IN THE GENOTYPE, MODELING TOWARDS ADAPTATION OF FOOD
    CROPS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE THREAT
  abstract: Agriculture is facing the disastrous effects of frequent drastic climate
    changes. Efforts have increased towards the implementation of inexpensive solutions
    for crop-yield prediction using publicly available data to prevent severe long-term
    problems like food scarcity and security, amongst others. Agricultural productiv-
    ity is intrinsic to the choice of plant species (i.e. cultivar) and represents
    oppor- tunity cost for farm managers. The currently used cultivars have been artificially
    selected for productivity at the expense of not being flexible to survive drastic
    cli- mate changes. Current state-of-the-art machine learning models have modelled
    holistically all agricultural counterparts (i.e. soil, management, weather, crop
    cul- tivars etc), albeit, oversimplifying some of the biological features of their
    culti- vars without taking advantage of their data properties. Specifically, these
    models oversimplify some biological features like the genotype making them irrelevant
    or depicting incomplete conclusions since not all of the information from the
    cul- tivar is incorporated. With the goal of creating new models that perform
    well on the yield prediction task in unstable weather conditions (e.g. under the
    effect of climate change), here the authors argue for the importance of incorporating
    additional biological features inferred from the genotype, like stability, and
    hy- pothesise that current state-of-the-art models for grain-yield prediction
    are blind to such features, and hence not applicable in such scenario.

  paper_title: Hurricane Nowcasting with Irregular Time-step using Neural-ODE and
    Video Prediction
  abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of extreme climate events is critical especially
    in the recent globally warming environment. Considering recent advancements in
    deep neural networks, it is worthwhile to tackle this problem as data-driven spatio-temporal
    prediction using neural networks. However, a nontrivial challenge in practice
    lies in irregular time gaps between which climate observation data are collected
    due to sensor errors and other issues. This paper proposes an approach for spatio-temporal
    hurricane prediction that can address this issue of irregular time gaps in collected
    data with a simple but robust end-to-end model based on Neural Ordinary Differential
    Equation and video prediction model based on Retrospective Cycle-GAN.

  paper_title: Indigenous Knowledge Aware Drought Monitoring, Forecasting and Prediction
    Using Deep Learning Techniques
  abstract: 'The general objective of this proposed research work is to design deep
    learning based hybrid comprehensive framework for drought monitoring, forecasting
    and prediction using scientific and indigenous knowledge as an integration of
    connectionist and symbolic AI. In Ethiopia, among all extreme climate events,
    drought is considered as the most complex phenomenon affecting the country and
    its impact is also high due to absence of locally grounded intelligent and explainable
    technology-oriented drought early warning and monitoring system. Thus, studying
    Ethiopic perspective of drought monitoring and prediction in line with continental
    and global climate change is vital for drought impact minimization and sustainable
    development of the country. Moreover, having technology assisted early protective,
    preventative action is also many times cheaper than the associated response to
    humanitarian crisis. Accordingly, this proposed work will have different expected
    outputs, including: drought risk identification, drought monitoring, drought preparedness,
    drought forecasting, drought mitigation, and post drought best practice recommendation
    models with interactive visualizations and explanations. '

  paper_title: 'TrueBranch: Metric Learning-based Verification of Forest Conservation
    Projects'
  abstract: |-
    International stakeholders increasingly invest in offsetting carbon emissions, for example, via issuing Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to forest conservation projects. Issuing trusted payments requires a transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) process of the ecosystem services (e.g., carbon stored in forests).
    The current MRV process, however, is either too expensive (on-ground inspection of forest) or inaccurate (satellite). Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining forest carbon from drone imagery, collected by the landowners. The automation of MRV, however, opens up the possibility that landowners report untruthful drone imagery. To be robust against untruthful reporting, we propose TrueBranch, a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the truthfulness of drone imagery from forest conservation projects.
    TrueBranch aims to detect untruthfully reported drone imagery by matching it with public satellite imagery. Preliminary results suggest that nominal distance metrics are not sufficient to reliably detect untruthfully reported imagery. TrueBranch leverages a method from metric learning to create a feature embedding in which truthfully and untruthfully collected imagery is easily distinguishable by distance thresholding.

  paper_title: Advancing Renewable Electricity Consumption With Reinforcement Learning
  abstract: As the share of renewable energy sources in the present electric energy
    mix rises, their intermittence proves to be the biggest challenge to carbon free
    electricity generation. To address this challenge, we propose an electricity pricing
    agent, which sends price signals to the customers and contributes to shifting
    the customer demand to periods of high renewable energy generation. We propose
    an implementation of a pricing agent with a reinforcement learning approach where
    the environment is represented by the customers, the electricity generation utilities
    and the weather conditions.

  paper_title: 'Xingu: Explaining critical geospatial predictions in weak supervision
    for climate finance'
  abstract: "Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) play a crucial key role
    in the decision-making of climate investors, policymakers and conservationists.
    \nRemote sensing is commonly used for MRV but practical solutions are constrained
    by a lack of labels to train machine learning-based downstream tasks. Recent work
    leverages weak supervision to alleviate the problem of labelled data scarcity.
    However, the definition of weak supervision signals is limited by the existence
    of millions of possible heuristic-based feature generation rules. Furthermore,
    these rules are often difficult to interpret for climate finance and underperform
    in critical data subsets. We propose Xingu, an interpretable MRV system to explain
    weak supervision rules using game-theoretic SHAP values for critical model predictions.
    Moreover, Xingu enables domain experts to collectively design and share labelling
    functions, thus curating a reusable knowledge base for weak supervision signals."

    production structure for a developing country like India. In doing so, it predicts
    and measure the effects of climate change on rice grown in tropical regions; secondly,it
    estimates the nutrient demand and its link with the climate change; thirdly, by
    modelling the yield uncertainty, it characterizes the risk and role for insurance
    as a tool for tackling climate change in the developing countries.'

    (CCTT)
  abstract: 'The objective of the present paper is to review the climate change technology
    transfer. This research proposes a method for analysing CCTT using patent analysis
    and topic modelling. A collection of climate change mitigation related technology
    (CCMT) patents from patent databases would be used as input to group patents in
    several relevant topics for climate change mitigation using the topic exploration
    model in this research. The research questions we want to address are: how have
    the patenting activities changed over time in CCMT patents? And who are the technological
    leaders? The investigation of these questions can offer the technological landscape
    in climate change-related technologies at the international level. We propose
    a hybrid Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach for topic modelling and identification
    of relationships between terms and topics related to CCMT, enabling better visualizations
    of underlying intellectual property dynamics. Further, we propose predictive modelling
    for CCTT and competitor analysis to identify and rank countries with a similar
    patent landscape. The projected results are expected to facilitate the transfer
    process associated with existing and emerging climate change technologies and
    improve technology cooperation between governments.'

  paper_title: Using ML to close the vocabulary gap in the context of environment
    and climate change in Chichewa
  abstract: 'In the west, alienation from nature and deteriorating opportunities to
    experience it, have led educators to incorporate educational programs in schools,
    to bring pupils in contact with nature and to enhance their understanding of issues
    related to the environment and its protection. In Africa, and in Malawi, where
    most people engage in agriculture, and spend most of their time in the ''outdoors'',
    alienation from nature is happening too, although in different ways.  Large portion
    of the indigenous vocabulary and knowledge remains unknown or is slowly disappearing,
    and there is a need to build a glossary of terms regarding environment and climate
    change in the vernacular to improve the dialog regarding climate change and environmental
    protection.. We believe that ML has a role to play in closing the ‘vocabulary
    gap’ of terms and concepts regarding the environment and climate change that exists
    in Chichewa and other Malawian languages by helping to creating a visual dictionary
    of key terms used to describe the environment and explain the issues involved
    in climate change and their meaning. Chichewa is a descriptive language, one English
    term may be translated using several words. Thus, the task is not to detect just
    literal translations, but also translations by means of ‘descriptions’ and illustrations
    and thus extract correspondence between terms and definitions and to  measure
    how appropriate a term is to convey the meaning intended.  As part of this project,
    ML can be used to identify ‘loanword patterns’, which may be useful in understanding
    the transmission of cultural items.
