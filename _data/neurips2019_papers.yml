  paper_title: Warm-Starting AC Optimal Power Flow with Graph Neural Networks
  abstract: 'Efficient control of power grids is important both for efficiently managing
    genera- tors and to prolong longevity of components. However, that problem is
    NP-hard and linear approximations are necessary. The deployment of machine learning
    methods is hampered by the need to guarantee solutions. We propose to use Graph
    Neural Networks (GNNs) to model a power grid and produce an initial solution used
    to warm-start the optimization. This allows us to achieve the best of both worlds:
    Fast convergence and guaranteed solutions. On a synthetic power grid modelling
    Texas, we achieve a mean speedup by a factor of 2.8. This allows us to dispense
    with linear approximation, leads to more efficient generator dispatch, and can
    potentially save hundreds of megatons of CO2 -equivalent.'

  paper_title: Quantifying Urban Canopy Cover with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
  abstract: Urban canopy cover is important to mitigate the impact of climate change.
    Yet, existing quantification of urban greenery is either manual and not scalable,
    or use traditional computer vision methods that are inaccurate. We train deep
    convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) on datasets used for self-driving cars to
    estimate urban greenery instead, and find that our semantic segmentation and direct
    end-to-end estimation method are more accurate and scalable, reducing mean absolute
    error of estimating the Green View Index (GVI) metric from 10.1% to 4.67%. With
    the revised DCNN methods, the Treepedia project was able to scale and analyze
    canopy cover in 22 cities internationally, sparking interest and action in public
    policy and research fields.

  paper_title: Using LSTMs for climate change assessment studies on droughts and floods
  abstract: Climate change affects occurrences of floods and droughts worldwide.  However,
    predicting climate impacts over individual watersheds is difficult, primarily
    because accurate hydrological forecasts require models that are calibrated to
    past data.  In this work we present a large-scale LSTM-based modeling approach
    that - by training on large data sets - learns a diversity of hydrological behaviors.
    Previous work shows that this model is more accurate than current state-of-the-art
    models, even when the LSTM-based approach operates out-of-sample and the latter
    in-sample. In this work, we show how this model can assess the sensitivity of
    the underlying systems with regard to extreme (high and low) flows in individual
    watersheds over the continental US.

  paper_title: Deep learning predictions of sand dune migration
  abstract: Climate change is making many desert regions warmer, drier, and sandier.
    These conditions kill vegetation, and release once-stable sand into the wind,
    allowing it to form dunes that threaten roads, farmland, and solar panel installations.
    With enough warning, people can mitigate dune damages by moving infrastructure
    or restoring vegetation. Current dune simulations, however, do not scale well
    enough to provide useful forecasts for the ~5% of Earth's land surface that is
    covered by mobile sands.   We propose to train a deep learning simulation to emulate
    the output of a community-standard physics-based dune simulation. We will base
    the new model on a GAN-based video prediction model with an excellent track record
    for predicting spatio-temporal patterns to model, and use it to simulate dune
    topographies over time. Our preliminary work indicates that the new model will
    run up to ten million times faster than existing dune simulations, which would
    turn dune modelling from an exercise that covers a handful of dunes to a practical
    forecast for large desert regions.

  paper_title: Learning to Focus and Track Hurricanes
  abstract: This paper tackles the task of extreme climate event tracking. We propose
    a simple but robust end-to-end model based on multi-layered ConvLSTMs, suitable
    for climate event tracking. It first learns to imprint the location and the appearance
    of the target at the first frame in an auto-encoding fashion. Next, the learned
    feature is fed to the tracking module to track the target in subsequent time frames.
    To tackle the data shortage problem, we propose data augmentation based on conditional
    generative adversarial networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
    framework significantly improves tracking performance of a hurricane tracking
    task over several state-of-the-art methods.

  paper_title: 'DeepWind: Weakly Supervised Localization of Wind Turbines in Satellite
    Imagery'
  abstract: Wind energy is being adopted at an unprecedented rate. The locations of
    wind energy sources, however, are largely undocumented and expensive to curate
    manually, which significantly impedes their integration into power systems. Towards
    the goal of mapping global wind energy infrastructure, we develop deep learning
    models to automatically localize wind turbines in satellite imagery. Using only
    image-level supervision, we experiment with several different weakly supervised
    convolutional neural networks to detect the presence and locations of wind turbines.
    Our best model, which we call DeepWind, achieves an average precision of 0.866
    on the test set. DeepWind demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for
    identifying wind turbine locations using satellite imagery, ultimately assisting
    with the management and adoption of wind energy worldwide.

  paper_title: Streamflow Prediction with Limited Spatially-Distributed Input Data
  abstract: Climate change causes more frequent and extreme weather phenomena across
    the globe. Accurate streamflow prediction allows for proactive and mitigative
    action in some of these events. As a first step towards models that predict streamflow
    in watersheds for which we lack ground truth measurements, we explore models that
    work on spatially-distributed input data. In such a scenario, input variables
    are more difficult to acquire, and thus models have access to limited training
    data. We present a case study focusing on Lake Erie, where we find that tree-based
    models can yield more accurate predictions than both neural and physically-based
    models.

  paper_title: Establishing an Evaluation Metric to Quantify Climate Change Image
    Realism
  abstract: With success on controlled tasks, generative models are being increasingly
    applied to humanitarian applications. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation
    of a conditional generative model that illustrates the consequences of climate
    change-induced flooding to encourage public interest and awareness on the issue.
    Because metrics for comparing the realism of different modes in a conditional
    generative model do not exist, we propose several automated and human-based methods
    for evaluation. To do this, we adapt several existing metrics, and assess the
    automated metrics against gold standard human evaluation. We find that using Frechet
    Inception Distance (FID) with embeddings from an intermediary Inception-V3 layer
    that precedes the auxiliary classifier produces results most correlated with human
    realism. While insufficient alone to establish a human-correlated automatic evaluation
    metric, we believe this work begins to bridge the gap between human and automated
    generative evaluation procedures.

  paper_title: 'Energy Usage Reports: Environmental awareness as part of algorithmic
    accountability'
  abstract: The carbon footprint of algorithms must be measured and transparently
    reported so computer scientists can take an honest and active role in environmental
    sustainability.  In this paper, we take analyses usually applied at the industrial
    level and make them accessible for individual computer science researchers with
    an easy-to-use Python package. Localizing to the energy mixture of the electrical
    power grid, we make the conversion from energy usage to CO2 emissions, in addition
    to contextualizing these results with more human-understandable benchmarks such
    as automobile miles driven. We also include comparisons with energy mixtures employed
    in electrical grids around the world. We propose including these automatically-generated
    Energy Usage Reports as part of standard algorithmic accountability practices,
    and demonstrate the use of these reports as part of model-choice in a machine
    learning context.

  paper_title: Natural Language Generation for Operations and Maintenance in Wind
    Turbines
  abstract: Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sustainable energy sources in
    the world but relies crucially on efficient and effective operations and maintenance
    to generate sufficient amounts of energy and reduce downtime of wind turbines
    and associated costs. Machine learning has been applied to predict faults in wind
    turbines, but these predictions have not been supported by suggestions on how
    to avert and fix occurring errors. In this paper, we present a data-to-text generation
    system utilising transformers to produce event descriptions of turbine faults
    from SCADA data capturing the operational status of turbines, and proposing maintenance
    strategies. Experiments show that our model learns reasonable feature representations
    that correspond to expert judgements. We anticipate that in making a contribution
    to the reliability of wind energy, we can encourage more organisations to switch
    to sustainable energy sources and help combat climate change.

  paper_title: Predictive Inference of a Wildfire Risk Pipeline in the United States
  abstract: Wildfires are rare events that present severe threats to life and property.
    Understanding their propagation is of key importance to mitigate and contain their
    impact, especially since climate change is increasing their occurrence. We propose
    an end-to-end sequential model of wildfire risk components, including wildfire
    location, size, duration, and risk exposure. We do so through a combination of
    marked spatio-temporal point processes and conditional density estimation techniques.
    Unlike other approaches that use regression-based methods, this approach allows
    both predictive accuracy and an associated uncertainty measure for each risk estimate,
    accounting for the uncertainty in prior model components. This is particularly
    beneficial for timely decision-making by different wildfire risk management stakeholders.
    To allow us to build our models without limiting them to a specific state or county,
    we have collected open wildfire and climate data for the entire continental United
    States. We are releasing this aggregated dataset to enable further o   pen research
    on wildfire models at a national scale.

  paper_title: Make Thunderbolts Less Frightening — Predicting Extreme Weather Using
    Deep Learning
  abstract: Forecasting severe weather conditions is still a very challenging and
    computationally expensive task due to the enormous amount of data and the complexity
    of the underlying physics. Machine learning approaches and especially deep learning
    have however shown huge improvements in many research areas dealing with large
    datasets in recent years. In this work, we tackle one speciﬁc sub-problem of weather
    forecasting, namely the prediction of thunderstorms and lightning. We propose
    the use of a convolutional neural network architecture inspired by UNet++ and
    ResNet to predict thunderstorms as a binary classiﬁcation problem based on satellite
    images and lightnings recorded in the past. We achieve a probability of detection
    of more than 94% for lightnings within the next 15 minutes while at the same time
    minimizing the false alarm ratio compared to previous approaches.

  paper_title: 'Cumulo: A Dataset for Learning Cloud Classes'
  abstract: One of the greatest sources of uncertainty in future climate projections
    comes from limitations in modelling clouds and in understanding how different
    cloud types interact with the climate system. A key first step in reducing this
    uncertainty is to accurately classify cloud types at high spatial and temporal
    resolution. In this paper, we introduce Cumulo, a benchmark dataset for training
    and evaluating global cloud classification models. It consists of one year of
    1km resolution MODIS  hyperspectral imagery merged with  pixel-width `tracks'
    of CloudSat cloud labels. Bringing these complementary datasets together is a
    crucial first step, enabling the Machine-Learning community to develop innovative
    new techniques which could greatly benefit the climate community. To showcase
    Cumulo, we provide baseline performance analysis using an invertible flow generative
    model (IResNet), which further allows us to discover new sub-classes for a given
    cloud class by exploring the latent space.

  paper_title: Targeting Buildings for Energy Retrofit Using Recurrent Neural Networks
    with Multivariate Time Series
  abstract: 'The existing building stock accounts for over 30% of global carbon emissions
    and energy demand. Effective building retrofits are therefore vital in reducing
    global emissions. Current methods for building energy assessment typically rely
    on walk-throughs, surveys or the collection of in-situ measurements, none of which
    are scalable or cost effective. Supervised machine learning methods have the potential
    to overcome these issues, but their application to retrofit analysis has been
    limited. This paper serves as a novel showcase for how multivariate time series
    analysis with Gated Recurrent Units can be applied to targeted retrofit analysis
    via two case studies: (1) classification of building heating system type and (2)
    prediction of building envelope thermal properties.'

  paper_title: Coupling Oceanic Observation Systems to Study Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics
  abstract: Understanding local currents in the North Atlantic region of the ocean
    is a key part of modelling heat transfer and global climate patterns. Satellites
    provide a surface signature of the temperature of the ocean with a high horizontal
    resolution while in situ autonomous probes supply high vertical resolution, but
    horizontally sparse, knowledge of the ocean interior thermal structure. The objective
    of this paper is to develop a methodology to combine these complementary ocean
    observing systems measurements to obtain a three-dimensional time series of ocean
    temperatures with high horizontal and vertical resolution. Within an observation-driven
    framework, we investigate the extent to which mesoscale ocean dynamics in the
    North Atlantic region may be decomposed into a mixture of dynamical modes, characterized
    by different local regressions between Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Level
    Anomalies (SLA) and Vertical Temperature fields. Ultimately we propose a Latent-class
    regression method to improve prediction of vertical ocean temperature.

  paper_title: Background noise trends and the detection of calving events in a glacial
    fjord
  abstract: Predicting future sea levels depends on accurately estimating the rate
    at which ice sheets deliver fresh water and ice to the oceans, and projecting
    rates of iceberg calving will be improved with more observations of calving events.
    The background noise environment in a glacial fjord was measured and the data
    were analyzed. This paper includes an analysis of methods useful for evaluating
    background noise. It explores the utility of spectral probability density in evaluating
    background noise characteristics in the frequency domain, models probability density
    functions of spectral levels and introduces a parameter \(\sigma_T\) that quantifies
    the character of noise in frequency bands of interest. It also explores the utility
    of k-medoids clustering as a pre-sorting method to inform the selection of features
    on which to base the training of more complex algorithms.

  paper_title: Reducing Inefficiency in Carbon Auctions with Imperfect Competition
  abstract: 'We study auctions for carbon licenses, a policy tool used to control
    the social cost of pollution. Each identical license grants the right to produce
    a unit of pollution. Each buyer (i.e., firm that pollutes during the manufacturing
    process) enjoys a decreasing marginal value for licenses, but society suffers
    an increasing marginal cost for each license distributed. The seller (i.e., the
    government) can choose a number of licenses to auction, and wishes to maximize
    societal welfare: the total economic value of the buyers minus the social cost.
    Motivated by emission license markets deployed in practice, we focus on uniform
    price auctions with a price floor and/or price ceiling. The seller has distributional
    information about the market, and their goal is to tune the auction parameters
    to maximize expected welfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected welfare
    achievable by any such auction under truth-telling behavior. Unfortunately, the
    uniform price auction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can significantly
    reduce (even below zero) the welfare of a given auction configuration.  We use
    tools from theoretical computer science and algorithmic game theory to address
    the strategic vulnerabilities of these auctions.  We describe a subclass of "safe-price"
    auctions for which the welfare at any Bayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate
    the welfare under truth-telling behavior. We then show that the better of a safe-price
    auction, or a truthful auction that allocates licenses to only a single buyer,
    will approximate the target benchmark. In particular, we show how to choose a
    number of licenses and a price floor so that the worst-case welfare, at any equilibrium,
    is a constant approximation to the best achievable welfare under truth-telling
    after excluding the welfare contribution of a single buyer. This provides a concrete
    recommendation for how to set the auction parameters in practice in order to achieve
    guarantees, even in the face of strategic participants.'

  paper_title: Reduction of the Optimal Power Flow Problem through Meta-Optimization
  abstract: We introduce a method for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) using meta-optimization,
    which can substantially reduce solution times. A pre-trained classifier that predicts
    the binding constraints of the system is used to generate an initial reduced OPF
    problem, defined by removing the predicted non-binding constraints. Through an
    iterative procedure, this initial set of constraints is then ex- tended by those
    constraints that are violated but not represented in the reduced OPF, guaranteeing
    an optimal solution of the original OPF problem with the full set of constraints.
    The classifier is trained using a meta-loss objective, defined by the computational
    cost of the series of reduced OPF problems.

  paper_title: Human-Machine Collaboration for Fast Land Cover Mapping
  abstract: We propose incorporating human labelers in a model fine-tuning system
    that provides immediate user feedback. In our framework, human labelers can interactively
    query model predictions on unlabeled data, choose which data to label, and see
    the resulting effect on the model's predictions. This bi-directional feedback
    loop allows humans to learn how the model responds to new data. Our hypothesis
    is that this rich feedback allows human labelers to create mental models that
    enable them to better choose which biases to introduce to the model. We implement
    this framework for fine-tuning high-resolution land cover segmentation models
    and evaluate it against traditional active learning based approaches. More specifically,
    we fine-tune a deep neural network -- trained to segment high-resolution aerial
    imagery into different land cover classes in Maryland, USA -- to a new spatial
    area in New York, USA. We find that the tight loop turns the algorithm and the
    human operator into a hybrid system that can produce land cover maps of large
    areas more efficiently than the traditional workflows.

  paper_title: A User Study of Perceived Carbon Footprint
  abstract: We propose a statistical model to understand people’s perception of their
    carbon footprint. Driven by the observation that few people think of CO2 impact
    in absolute terms, we design a system to probe people’s perception from simple
    pairwise comparisons of the relative carbon footprint of their actions. The formulation
    of the model enables us to take an active-learning approach to selecting the pairs
    of actions that are maximally informative about the model parameters. We define
    a set of 18 actions and collect a dataset of 2183 comparisons from 176 users on
    a university campus. The early results reveal promising directions to improve
    climate communication and enhance climate mitigation.

  paper_title: Design, Benchmarking and Graphical Lasso based Explainability Analysis
    of an Energy Game-Theoretic Framework
  abstract: Energy use in buildings account for approximately half of global electricity
    consumption and a significant amount of CO2 emissions. The occupants of a building
    typically lack the independent motivation necessary to optimize their energy usage.
    In this paper, we propose a novel energy game-theoretic framework for smart building
    which incorporates human-in-the-loop modeling by creating an interface to allow
    interaction with occupants and potentially incentivize energy efficient behavior.
    We present open-sourced dataset and benchmarked results for forecasting of energy
    resource usage patterns by leveraging classical machine learning and deep learning
    methods including deep bi-directional recurrent neural networks. Finally, we use
    graphical lasso to demonstrate the explainable nature on human decision making
    towards energy usage inherent in the dataset.

  paper_title: Predicting ice flow using machine learning
  abstract: Though machine learning has achieved notable success in modeling sequential
    and spatial data for speech recognition and in computer vision, applications to
    remote sensing and climate science problems are seldom considered. In this paper,
    we demonstrate techniques from unsupervised learning of future video frame prediction,
    to increase the accuracy of ice flow tracking in multi-spectral satellite images.
    As the volume of cryosphere data increases in coming years, this is an interesting
    and important opportunity for machine learning to address a global challenge for
    climate change, risk management from floods, and conserving freshwater resources.
    Future frame prediction of ice melt and tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics
    presents modeling difficulties, due to uncertainties in global temperature increase,
    changing precipitation patterns, occlusion from cloud cover, rapid melting and
    glacier retreat due to black carbon aerosol deposition, from wildfires or human
    fossil emissions. We show the adversarial learning method helps improve the accuracy
    of tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics compared to existing methods in climate
    science. We present a dataset, IceNet, to encourage machine learning research
    and to help facilitate further applications in the areas of cryospheric science
    and climate change.

  paper_title: 'DeepClimGAN: A High-Resolution Climate Data Generator'
  abstract: Earth system models (ESMs), which simulate the physics and chemistry of
    the global atmosphere, land, and ocean, are often used to generate future projections
    of climate change scenarios. These models are far too computationally intensive
    to run repeatedly, but limited sets of runs are insufficient for some important
    applications, like adequately sampling distribution tails to characterize extreme
    events. As a compromise, emulators are substantially less expensive but may not
    have all of the complexity of an ESM. Here we demonstrate the use of a conditional
    generative adversarial network (GAN) to act as an ESM emulator. In doing so, we
    gain the ability to produce daily weather data that is consistent with what ESM
    might output over any chosen scenario. In particular, the GAN is aimed at representing
    a joint probability distribution over space, time, and climate variables, enabling
    the study of correlated extreme events, such as floods, droughts, or heatwaves.

  paper_title: Quantifying the Carbon Emissions of Machine Learning
  abstract: 'From an environmental standpoint, there are a few crucial aspects of
    training a neural network that have a major impact on the quantity of carbon that
    it emits. These factors include: the location of the server used for training
    and the energy grid that it uses, the length of the training procedure, and even
    the make and model of hardware on which the training takes place. In order to
    approximate these emissions, we present our Machine Learning Emissions Calculator,
    a tool for our community to better understand the environmental impact of training
    ML models. We accompany this tool with an explanation of the factors cited above,
    as well as concrete actions that individual practitioners as well as organizations
    can take to mitigate their carbon emissions.'

  paper_title: 'Measuring Impact of Climate Change on Tree Species: analysis of JSDM
    on FIA data'
  abstract: One of the first beings affected by changes in the climate are trees,
    one of our most vital resources. In this study tree species interaction and the
    response to climate in different ecological environments is observed by applying
    a joint species distribution model to different ecological domains in the United
    States. Joint species distribution models are useful to learn inter-species relationships
    and species response to the environment. The climates’ impact on the tree species
    is measured through species abundance in an area. We compare the model’s performance
    across all ecological domains and study the sensitivity of the climate variables.
    With the prediction of abundances, tree species populations can be predicted in
    the future and measure the impact of climate change on tree populations.

  paper_title: A Global Census of Solar Facilities Using Deep Learning and Remote
    Sensing
  abstract: We present a comprehensive global census of solar power facilities using
    deep learning and remote sensing. We search imagery from the Airbus SPOT 6/7 and
    European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellites covering more than 48% of earth’s
    land-surface using a combination of deep-learning models, image processing, and
    hand-verification. We locate solar facilities and measure their footprints and
    installation dates. The resulting dataset of 68,797 facilities has an estimated
    generating capacity of 209 GW; 78% of this capacity was not previously reported
    in public databases. These asset-level data are critical for understanding energy
    infrastructure, evaluate climate risk, and efficiently use intermittent solar
    energy - ultimately enabling the transition to a predominantly renewable energy
    system.

  paper_title: Machine Learning for Precipitation Nowcasting from Radar Images
  abstract: 'High-resolution nowcasting is an essential tool needed for effective
    adaptation to climate change, particularly for extreme weather.  As Deep Learning
    (DL) techniques have shown dramatic promise in many domains, including the geosciences,
    we present an application of DL to the problem of precipitation nowcasting, i.e.,
    high-resolution (1 km x 1 km) short-term (1 hour) predictions of precipitation.  We
    treat forecasting as an image-to-image translation problem and leverage the power
    of the ubiquitous UNET convolutional neural network.  We find this performs favorably
    when compared to three commonly used models: optical flow, persistence and NOAA''s
    numerical one-hour HRRR nowcasting prediction.'

  paper_title: Enhancing Stratospheric Weather Analyses and Forecasts by Deploying
    Sensors from a Weather Balloon
  abstract: The ability to analyze and forecast stratospheric weather conditions is
    fundamental to addressing climate change.   However,  our capacity to collect
    data in the stratosphere is limited by sparsely deployed weather balloons. We
    propose a framework to collect stratospheric data by releasing a contrail of tiny
    sensor devices as a weather balloon ascends.   The key machine learning challenges
    are determining when and how to deploy a finite collection of sensors to produce
    a useful data set.  We decide when to release sensors by modeling the deviation
    of a forecast from actual stratospheric conditions as a Gaussian process. We then
    implement a novel hardware system that is capable of optimally releasing sensors
    from a rising weather balloon.  We show that this data engineering framework is
    effective through real weather balloon flights, as well as simulations.

  paper_title: Automatic data cleaning via tensor factorization for large urban environmental
    sensor networks
  abstract: The US Environmental Protection Agency identifies that urban heat islands
    can negatively impact a community’s environment and quality of life. Using low
    cost urban sensing networks, it is possible to measure the impacts of mitigation
    strategies at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure
    design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by tedious
    data cleaning including removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address
    the challenge of data cleaning, this article introduces a robust low-rank tensor
    factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries
    for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets. We validate the method on a
    synthetically degraded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature
    dataset, with a recovery error of 4%, and apply it to the Array of Things city-scale
    sensor network in Chicago, IL.

  paper_title: Machine Learning-based Estimation of Forest Carbon Stocks to increase
    Transparency of Forest Preservation Efforts
  abstract: An increasing amount of companies and cities plan to become CO2-neutral,
    which requires them to invest in renewable energies and carbon emission offsetting
    solutions. One of the cheapest carbon offsetting solutions is preventing deforestation
    in developing nations, a major contributor in global greenhouse gas emissions.
    However, forest preservation projects historically display an issue of trust and
    transparency, which drives companies to invest in transparent, but expensive air
    carbon capture facilities. Preservation projects could conduct accurate forest
    inventories (tree diameter, species, height etc.) to transparently estimate the
    biomass and amount of stored carbon. However, current rainforest inventories are
    too inaccurate, because they are often based on a few expensive ground-based samples
    and/or low-resolution satellite imagery. LiDAR-based solutions, used in US forests,
    are accurate, but cost-prohibitive, and hardly-accessible in the Amazon rainforest.
    We propose accurate and cheap forest inventory analyses through Deep Learning-based
    processing of drone imagery. The more transparent estimation of stored carbon
    will create higher transparency towards clients and thereby increase trust and
    investment into forest preservation projects.

  paper_title: Identify Solar Panels in Low Resolution Satellite Imagery with Siamese
    Architecture and Cross-Correlation
  abstract: Understanding solar adoption trends and their underlying dynamics requires
    a comprehensive and granular time-series solar installation database which is
    unavailable today and expensive to create manually. To this end, we leverage a
    deep siamese network that automatically identifies solar panels in historical
    low-resolution (LR) satellite images by comparing the target image with its high-resolution
    exemplar at the same location. To resolve the potential displacement between solar
    panels in the exemplar image and that in the target image, we use a cross-correlation
    module to collate the spatial features learned from each input and measure their
    similarity. Experimental result shows that our model significantly outperforms
    baseline methods on a dataset of historical LR images collected in California.

  paper_title: Autonomous Sensing and Scientific Machine Learning for Monitoring Greenhouse
    Gas Emissions
  abstract: Greenhouse gas emissions are a key driver of climate change. In order
    to develop and tune climate models, measurements of natural and anthropogenic
    phenomenon are necessary. Traditional methods (i.e., physical sample collection
    and ex situ analysis) tend to be sample sparse and low resolution, whereas global
    remote sensing methods tend to miss small- and mid-scale dynamic phenomenon. In
    situ instrumentation carried by a robotic platform is suited to study greenhouse
    gas emissions at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, collecting
    scientifically rich datasets of dynamic or transient emission events requires
    accurate and flexible models of gas emission dynamics. Motivated by applications
    in seasonal Arctic thawing and volcanic outgassing, we propose the use of scientific
    machine learning, in which traditional scientific models (in the form of ODEs/PDEs)
    are combined with machine learning techniques (generally neural networks) to better
    incorporate data into a structured, interpretable model. Our technical contributions
    will primarily involve developing these hybrid models and leveraging model uncertainty
    estimates during sensor planning to collect data that efficiently improves gas
    emission models in small-data domains.

  paper_title: 'VideoGasNet: Deep Learning for Natural Gas Methane Leak Classification
    Using An Infrared Camera'
  abstract: Mitigating methane leakage from the natural gas system have become an
    increasing concern for climate change. Efficacious methane leak detection and
    classification can make the mitigation process more efficient and cost effective.
    Optical gas imaging is widely used for the purpose of leak detection, but it cannot
    directly provide detection results and leak sizes. Few studies have examined the
    possibility of leak classification using videos taken by the infrared camera (IR),
    an optical gas imaging device. In this study, we consider the leak classification
    problem as a video classification problem and investigated the application of
    deep learning techniques in methane leak detection. Firstly we collected the first
    methane leak video dataset - GasVid, which has ~1 M frames of labeled videos of
    methane leaks from different leaking equipment, covering a wide range of leak
    sizes (5.3-2051.6 g\ce{CH4}/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m). Secondly, we
    studied three deep learning algorithms, including 2D Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNN) model, 3D CNN and the Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM). We
    find that 3D CNN is the most outstanding and robust architecture, which was named
    VideoGasNet. The leak-non-leak detection accuracy can reach 100%, and the highest
    small-medium-large classification accuracy is 78.2% with our 3D CNN network. In
    summary, VideoGasNet greatly extends the capabilities of IR camera-based leak
    monitoring system from leak detection only to automated leak classification with
    high accuracy and fast processing speed, significant mitigation efficiency.

  paper_title: Detecting Avalanche Deposits using Variational Autoencoder on Sentinel-1
    Satellite Imagery
  abstract: Avalanche monitoring is a crucial safety challenge, especially in a changing
    climate. Remote sensing of avalanche deposits can be very useful to identify avalanche
    risk zones and time periods, which can in turn provide insights about the effects
    of climate change.   In this work, we use Sentinel-1  SAR  (synthetic aperture
    radar) data on the French Alps for the exceptional winter of 2017-18, with the
    goal of automatically detecting avalanche deposits.   We address our problem with
    an unsupervised learning technique.  We treat an avalanche as a rare event, or
    an anomaly,  and we learn a variational autoencoder,  in order to isolate the
    anomaly. We then evaluate our method on labeled test data, using an independent
    in-situ avalanche inventory as ground truth. Our empirical results show that our
    unsupervised method obtains comparable performance to a recent supervised learning
    approach that trained a convolutional neural network on an artificially balanced
    version of the same SAR data set along with the corresponding ground-truth labels.
    Our unsupervised approach outperforms the standard CNN in terms of balanced accuracy
    (63% as compared to 55%). This is a significant improvement, as it allows our
    method to be used in-situ by climate scientists, where the data is always very
    unbalanced (< 2% positives). This is the first application of unsupervised deep
    learning to detect avalanche deposits.

  paper_title: Fine-Grained Distribution Grid Mapping Using Street View Imagery
  abstract: Fine-grained distribution grid mapping is essential for power system operation
    and planning in the aspects of renewable energy integration, vegetation management,
    and risk assessment. However, currently such information can be inaccurate, outdated,
    or incomplete. Existing grid topology reconstruction methods heavily rely on various
    assumptions and measurement data that is not widely available. To bridge this
    gap, we propose a machine-learning-based method that automatically detects, localizes,
    and estimates the interconnection of distribution power lines and utility poles
    using readily-available street views in the upward perspective. We demonstrate
    the superior image-level and region-level accuracy of our method on a real-world
    distribution grid test case.

    In our test case, we optimize the stability of perovskite compositions for perovskite
    solar cells, an efficient new solar cell technology suffering from limited lifetime

  paper_title: Increasing performance of electric vehicles in ride-hailing services
    using deep reinforcement learning
  abstract: New forms of on-demand transportation such as ride-hailing and connected
    autonomous vehicles are proliferating, yet are a challenging use case for electric
    vehicles (EV). This paper explores the feasibility of using deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) to optimize a driving and charging policy for a ride-hailing EV
    agent, with the goal of reducing costs and emissions while increasing transportation
    service provided. We introduce a data-driven simulation of a ride-hailing EV agent
    that provides transportation service and charges energy at congested charging
    infrastructure. We then formulate a test case for the sequential driving and charging
    decision making problem of the agent and apply DRL to optimize the agent's decision
    making policy. We evaluate the performance against heuristic policies and show
    that our agent learns to act competitively without any prior knowledge.

  paper_title: Optimizing trees for carbon sequestration
  abstract: In the IPCC models of climate change mitigation, most scenarios ensuring
    less than 2ºC of warming assume deployment of some form of “negative emissions
    technology,” alongside dramatic reductions in emissions and other major societal
    changes. Proposed negative emissions technologies include bioenergy with carbon
    capture and storage, enhanced weathering of minerals, direct air capture, and
    afforestation / reforestation. Among these technologies, the use of trees for
    carbon sequestration through photosynthesis is well established, requires little
    energy, has comparable sequestration potential, and can be deployed at scale for
    relatively low cost. The primary constraint on using trees for sequestration is
    land, which is limited and increasingly subject to competitive demand. Thus, maximizing
    the capacity and long-term stability of every hectare used for planting would
    bolster the critical role of trees in a broad negative emissions strategy. Here,
    we propose to build a new data resource and optimization tool that leverages modern
    measurements and machine learning to help address this need.

  paper_title: 'Toward Resilient Cities: Using Deep Learning to Downscale Climate
    Model Projections'
  abstract: Climate projections from Earth System Models (ESM) are widely used to
    assess climate change impacts. These projections, however, are too coarse in spatial
    and temporal resolution (e.g. 25-50 kms, monthly) to be used in local scale resilience
    studies. High-resolution (<4 km) climate projections at dense temporal resolution
    (hourly) from multiple Earth System models under various scenarios are necessary
    to assess potential future changes in climate variables and perform meaningful
    and robust climate resilience studies. Running ESMs in high-resolution is computationally
    too expensive, therefore downscaling methods are applied to ESM projections to
    produce high-resolution projections. Using a regional climate model to downscale
    climate projections is preferred but dynamically downscaling several ESM projections
    to < 4km resolution under different scenarios is currently not feasible. In this
    study, we propose to use a 60 year dynamically downscaled climate dataset with
    hourly output for the Northeastern United States to train Deep Learning models
    and achieve a computationally efﬁcient method of downscaling climate projections.
    This method will allow for more ESM projections to be downscaled to local scales
    under more scenarios in an efﬁcient manner and signiﬁcantly improve robustness
    of regional resilience studies.

  paper_title: Stripping off the implementation complexity of physics-based model
    predictive control for buildings via deep learning
  abstract: Over the past decade, model predictive control (MPC) has been considered
    as the most promising solution for intelligent building operation. Despite extensive
    effort, transfer of this technology into practice is hampered by the need to obtain
    an accurate controller model with minimum effort, the need of expert knowledge
    to set it up, and the need of increased computational power and dedicated software
    to run it. A promising direction that tackles the last two problems was proposed
    by approximate explicit MPC where the optimal control policies are learned from
    MPC data via a suitable function approximator, e.g., a deep learning (DL) model.  The
    main advantage of the proposed approach stems from simple evaluation at execution
    time leading to low computational footprints and easy deployment on embedded HW
    platforms. We present the energy savings potential of physics-based (also called
    'white-box') MPC applied to an office building in Belgium. Moreover, we demonstrate
    how deep learning approximators can be used to cut the implementation and maintenance
    costs of MPC deployment without compromising performance. We also critically assess
    the presented approach by pointing out the major challenges and remaining open-research
    questions.

  paper_title: Towards self-adaptive building energy control in smart grids
  abstract: Energy consumption in buildings greatly contributes to worldwide CO2 emissions
    and thus any improvement in HVAC operation will greatly help tackling global climate
    change. We are putting forward a proposal for self-adaptive energy control in
    smart grids based on Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent
    technologies. Particularly, we introduce the concept of Deep Neural Simulation
    Model (DNSM) as a way of generating digital twins of buildings in which the agent
    can test and learn optimal operations by itself and by collaborating with other
    agents. Not only do we expect a reduction on energy consumption and an increment
    on the use of renewable sources, but also a reduction on the cost of controlling
    energy in buildings.

  paper_title: Machine learning identifies the most valuable synthesis conditions
    for next-generation photovoltaics
  abstract: 'Terawatts of next-generation photovoltaics (PV) are necessary to mitigate
    climate change. The traditional R&D paradigm leads to high efficiency / high variability
    solar cells, limiting industrial scaling of novel PV materials. In this work,
    we propose a machine learning approach for early-stage optimization of solar cells,
    by combining a physics-informed deep autoencoder and a manufacturing-relevant
    Bayesian optimization objective. This framework allows to: 1) Co-optimize solar
    cell performance and variability under techno-economic revenue constrains, and
    2) Infer the effect of process conditions over key latent physical properties.
    We test our approach by synthesizing 135 perovskite solar cells, and finding the
    optimal points under various techno-economic assumptions.'

  paper_title: Helping Reduce Environmental Impact of Aviation with Machine Learning
  abstract: Commercial aviation is one of the biggest contributors towards climate
    change. We propose to reduce environmental impact of aviation by considering solutions
    that would reduce the flight time. Specifically, we first consider improving winds
    aloft forecast so that flight planners could use better information to find routes
    that are efficient. Secondly, we propose an aircraft routing method that seeks
    to find the fastest route to the destination by considering uncertainty in the
    wind forecasts and then optimally trading-off between exploration and exploitation.
    Both these ideas were previously published in [5] and [8] and contain further
    technical details.

  paper_title: Machine Learning for Generalizable Prediction of Flood Susceptibility
  abstract: Flooding is a destructive and dangerous hazard and climate change appears
    to be increasing the frequency of catastrophic flooding events around the world.
    Physics-based flood models are costly to calibrate and are rarely generalizable
    across different river basins, as model outputs are sensitive to site-specific
    parameters and human-regulated infrastructure. Statistical models trained primarily
    from remotely-sensed Earth observation data could reduce the need for extensive
    in-situ measurements. In this work, we develop generalizable, multi-basin models
    of river flooding susceptibility using geographically-distributed data from the
    USGS stream gauge network. Machine learning models are trained in a supervised
    framework to predict two measures of flood susceptibility from a mix of river
    basin attributes, impervious surface cover information derived from satellite
    imagery, and historical records of rainfall and stream height. We report prediction
    performance of multiple models using precision-recall curves, and compare with
    performance of naive baselines. This work on multi-basin flood prediction represents
    a step in the direction of making flood prediction accessible to all at-risk communities.

  paper_title: A Deep Learning-based Framework for the Detection of Schools of Herring
    in Echograms
  abstract: Tracking the abundance of underwater species is crucial for understanding
    the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. Biologists typically monitor
    underwater sites with echosounders and visualize data as 2D images (echograms);
    they interpret these data manually or semi-automatically, which is time-consuming
    and prone to inconsistencies. This paper proposes a deep learning framework for
    the automatic detection of schools of herring from echograms. Experiments demonstrated
    that our approach outperforms a traditional machine learning algorithm that uses
    hand-crafted features. Our framework could easily be expanded to detect more species
    of interest to sustainable fisheries.

  paper_title: Emulating Numeric Hydroclimate Models with Physics-Informed cGANs
  abstract: Process-based numerical simulations, including those for climate modeling
    applications, are compute and resource intensive, requiring extensive customization
    and hand-engineering for encoding governing equations and other domain knowledge.
    On the other hand, modern deep learning employs a significantly simpler and more
    efficient computational workflow, and has been shown impressive results across
    a myriad of applications in the computational sciences. In this work, we investigate
    the potential of deep generative learning models, specifically conditional Generative
    Adversarial Networks (cGANs), to simulate the output of a physics-based model
    of the spatial distribution of the water content of mountain snowpack - the snow
    water equivalent (SWE). We show preliminary results indicating that the cGAN model
    is able to learn diverse mappings between meteorological forcings and SWE output.  Thus
    physics based cGANs provide a means for fast and accurate SWE modeling that can
    have significant impact in a variety of applications (e.g., hydropower forecasting,
    agriculture, and water supply management). In climate science, the Snowpack and
    SWE are seen as some of the best indicative variables for investigating climate
    change and its impact. The massive speedups, diverse sampling, and sensitivity/saliency
    modelling that cGANs can bring to SWE estimation will be extremely important to
    investigating variables linked to climate change as well as predicting and forecasting
    the potential effects of climate change to come.

  paper_title: 'GeoLabels: Towards Efficient Ecosystem Monitoring using Data Programming
    on Geospatial Information'
  abstract: Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems for land use play
    a key role in the decision-making of climate investors, policymakers and conservationists.  Remote
    sensing is commonly used for MRV but practical solutions are constrained by a
    lack of labels to train machine learning-based downstream tasks. GeoLabels is
    an automated MRV system that can rapidly adapt to novel applications by leveraging
    existing geospatial information and domain expertise to quickly create training
    sets through data programming. Moreover, GeoLabels uses dimensionality reduction
    interfaces, allowing non-technical users to create visual labeling functions.

  paper_title: A deep learning approach for classifying black carbon aerosol morphology
  abstract: Black carbon (BC) is a sub-micron aerosol sourced from incomplete combustion
    which strongly absorbs solar radiation, leading to both direct and indirect climate
    impacts. The state-of-the-art technique for characterizing BC is the single particle
    soot photometer (SP2) instrument, which detects these aerosols in real time via
    laser-induced incandescence (L-II). This measurement technique allows for quantification
    of BC mass on a single particle basis, but time-resolved signals may also provide
    constraints on BC morphology, which impacts both its optical properties and atmospheric
    lifetime. No methods currently exist to use this information. I propose applying
    a deep learning based approach to classify the fractal dimension of single BC
    particles from time-resolved L-II signals. This method would provide the first
    on-line measurement technique for quantifying BC morphology. These observations
    could be used to improve representations of BC optical properties and atmospheric
    processing in climate models.

  paper_title: Forecasting El Niño with Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks
  abstract: The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of variability
    in the climate system on seasonal to decadal timescales. With foreknowledge of
    the state of ENSO, stakeholders can anticipate and mitigate impacts in climate-sensitive
    sectors such as agriculture and energy. Traditionally, ENSO forecasts have been
    produced using either computationally intensive physics-based dynamical models
    or statistical models that make limiting assumptions, such as linearity between
    predictors and predictands. Here we present a  deep-learning-based methodology
    for forecasting monthly ENSO temperatures at various lead times. While traditional
    statistical methods both train and validate on observational data, our method
    trains exclusively on physical simulations. With the entire observational record
    as an out-of-sample validation set, the method’s skill is comparable to that of
    operational dynamical models. The method is also used to identify disagreements
    among climate models about the predictability of ENSO in a world with climate
    change.
